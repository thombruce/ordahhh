A part of that final intention will be making politics actually palatable, because politics in general is pretty unpalatable. Most of us would much rather not bother with the whole thing until the next general election comes around. But then, I contest, if we don't pay attention during the interim between pledges to be elected or reelected, we miss the most important decisions of all - the ones not made simply to impress us, the ones not made to secure our vote. That was the fundamental problem that led me to conceive of 3D Politics in the first place; we should know the policy decisions our representatives are making when they least think their decisions are being observed. And we should be able to voice our decisions on those policies too. That's already possible, I know, but it isn't exactly simple. It's - arguably - deliberately obscure, lengthy and outmoded. And where the means of our political communication aren't outmoded - social media, for instance - they are argumentative and divisive; discourse concerns itself with flashy headlines designed to engage and outrage, all of which looks the same to the algorithms that decide what to show us and where to direct our interest. Wouldn't it be so much better to have a calm space where debate could be exchanged without the driving factors being sensation and division?

This itself is fiercely debated in order to politicise all manner of matters; the social, the medical, the environmental. There are some who'll claim everything's political, and some who want that to be the case because it is easier to contest a point when it is framed as political opinion rather than fact or science. In a way then... everything is political, because there are political agents forcing that to be the case. In the strictest sense though, politics is the discussion of governance. It is the debate or discourse pertaining to the selection of government, the application of governance over the governed and the reasoning applied to both. That's... broad.
